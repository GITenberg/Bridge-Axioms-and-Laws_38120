<h2>BRIDGE AXIOMS</h2>

<p>The best Bridge players are undoubtedly those who can draw inferences
quickly and correctly.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Observation is an art enabling one to discover what other people's play
conceals&mdash;as well as reveals.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Observation always infers, and one inference will lead to another.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Each card played speaks through its silence, and its language must be
understood.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>To converse intelligently through the medium of the cards, each<a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a> must be
seen as it falls with eyes that grasp its meaning.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Failure to note the play of a card is not lack of memory, but lack of
heed.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Situations are kaleidoscopic and constant, and success may only be
achieved by being perpetually alert to note them.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>All time at Bridge should be devoted earnestly to what confronts a
player, not to what is past.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is better not to play at all, than to play without earnestness.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>One careful game is worth any number of slipshod, careless efforts<a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a>
which are disconcerting to your partner, and the delight of your
adversaries.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Bridge abounds with situations which must be learned.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Promptness in making a conclusion is a mental inspiration as well as an
aid to expeditious play.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Hap-hazard play, first from one suit and then from another, will not
induce a successful campaign in Bridge.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Haste and waste are anti-types in Bridge, as they are in everything.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>To improve your Bridge, theory and practice must go hand in hand.<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a></p>

<p>Bridge is a game of which much is learned through the mistakes made and
heeded.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Do not fail to profit in future games by the mistakes that you discover
in present play.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>When you see clever plays that are new to you, analyse the motives that
underlie them.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The soundest play will sometimes lose, and the worst will sometimes win.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Uniform good play, no matter what the luck may be, will ultimately
triumph over bad play.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Tricks heedlessly lost mar the successful enjoyment of Bridge.<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a></p>

<p>That you happily did not lose on a hand, is no palliation for the bad
play of which you may have been guilty.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Do not overlook the tricks which may be gained by the use of a little
card strategy.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Memory is simply a matter of observation and practice.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Careful Bridge cultivates memory.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>What is done with a hand cannot be undone.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>A successful partnership game must be based on perfect faith and
confidence between partners.<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a></p>

<p>Combined play in Bridge is absolutely essential to success.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>When you accept a partner, you accept him as he is, not as you might
wish him to be.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>A trust in your partner's Bridge ability will overcome many obstacles in
the way of drawing inferences.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If your partner objects to moving, do not advise him to change.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Do not begin by abusing your partner for the make; you practically say
your hand is weak and the situation hopeless.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Your partner will play a better<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a> game if he does not fear your adverse
criticism.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Do not tell your partner, after seeing all the cards, what he should
have done; but think what you would have done in your partner's place.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The chronic complainant is a pessimistic partner and a peevish
adversary.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>One grain of encouragement is worth a pound of scolding in Bridge.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If you take advantage of your partner's breach of etiquette, you lay
yourself open to adverse criticism.<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a></p>

<p>The moment that you show subserviency you admit superiority.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Cards do not carry with them a license to be unfair or rude.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is more important to inform your partner than to deceive your
adversary.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Be generous with your praise of a well played hand.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Play the weak hands as interestedly as the strong.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Do not criticise at all; but&mdash;if you must&mdash;criticise fairly.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Never call attention to the score after the cards have been dealt.<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a></p>

<p>No matter how cleverly the cards are managed, the player who
underestimates the attention the state of the score demands will
unnecessarily lose many a rubber.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The necessity for keeping the score constantly in mind grows upon all
players as their experience in Bridge increases.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Know the requisite number of tricks to be taken, both to win and to save
the game.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>When you are a game behind, do not hesitate to gamble.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>When you are a game to the good, make none but a conservative and sound
declaration.<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a></p>

<p>When the score is 18 to nothing against you on the first game, or when
you are a game to the good, avoid a doubtful declaration which may
enable the adversaries to win the game on your deal.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>When the make is passed to you at a score of 24 all on the rubber game,
declare your best suit.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>When the game is saved, but cannot possibly be won, the seventh trick
should be the objective point.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>When you cannot reach game, never hazard the odd trick in an attempt to
win two odd.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Many times the game can only be won or saved in case the cards<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a> lie in a
certain position. Assume that the cards are favourably placed and play
the hand accordingly.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>When the game is seemingly lost, take the one chance of finding in your
partner's hand the cards that will save it.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is surprising how often a desperate expedient will overcome a
desperate situation.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>To force luck is to attempt to make it&mdash;a most idle task.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Human nature tempts mortals to lose more than they can win, sometimes
more than they can afford.<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a></p>

<p>Press good fortune while it lasts and do not linger when it refuses to
smile.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If you win with invincible cards, your victory is cheap.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Do not ascribe to bad luck the result of bad play.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Whoever is favoured by luck may usually take all manner of chances and
succeed.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>More rubbers are lost by bad makes than by bad plays.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Often the result of one hand, which proves nothing, will encourage the
tendency toward unsound makes.<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a></p>

<p>The question "What will be the probable make if I pass?" is of great
assistance in determining the declaration.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is remarkable how many passed "no-trumpers" go astray; and the number
proves the necessity for more cautious passed makes.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>A good player can take more chances with the make because of his ability
to play the cards properly.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>No-trump play is an effort to establish and bring in small cards of a
long suit.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Many a hand is ruined by careless<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a> and hasty play at the first trick.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Do not play your adversary's game for him, lend him no aid in
establishing his suit.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Take all your finesses against the player who holds an established suit.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If, as dealer, you wish to make four tricks in a suit with but three in
sight, give the adversaries a chance to discard.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>When there are tricks that the adversaries must win, try to make this
necessity a benefit to your hand.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Rid yourself of any high card<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a> which may interrupt the continuation of
your partner's suit.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The dealer's main plan of a trump hand should be to exhaust trumps and
bring in a suit.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Be cognisant of what you should accomplish and then decide how best to
do it.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Pitfalls in the form of false leads, false cards and clever under-play
should be dug for your adversaries at every opportunity.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Too much haste in showing ability to ruff in the weak trump hand
frequently brings disaster.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>When you are reasonably assured<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a> of every trick but one, lead your
remaining trump.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>As a rule avoid an inclination to ruff in the strong trump hand.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Remember that the partner who doubles usually has trump strength, and do
not strew his pathway with obstructions by forcing him.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is unusually bad play to double when you need only an odd trick to
win the game.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The card led by your partner is a message of his holding in that suit.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Many a rubber is lost which the prompt lead of a high card might have
saved.<a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a></p>

<p>It is too late to force when the adversaries hold the remaining trumps
and an established suit.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Ruffing with a commanding trump rarely loses a trick and often gains
one.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The temptation to over-trump should frequently be resisted.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Clear your long suit before you part with your card of re-entry.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Cultivate uniformity in your style of play, let there be no remarkable
haste or hesitation in making or passing, and look as cheerful as
possible.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Hesitation and mannerisms in Bridge should be carefully avoided.<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a></p>

<p>Emphasise no play of your own, and show no pleasure or displeasure at
any play.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Superiority of skill is shown by the play of the cards, not by
mannerisms.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Continued hesitancy and nervous indecision are serious faults in Bridge.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Make up your mind to do your best with the cards that have been dealt
you.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The occupant of the "high-chair" usually has a monopoly for giving
advice.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Let your manner be uniformly<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a> such that no one can tell from it whether
you are winning or losing.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Play Bridge with an eloquent silence; it will command both respect and
admiration.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>An occasional mistake is preferable to an irritating delay.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Slow play is, more or less, a habit. Its effect amounts to a fault.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>When there is an unusual distribution of the cards, remarks are
superfluous.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Indecision may tell your adversaries exactly what they are most eager to
know.<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a></p>

<p>Deliberation at the beginning of a hand is permissible and should be
encouraged.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The player who interrupts the game to discuss the play should be
ostracised from the card room.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Make no overt remarks during the play which may tend to give the
adversaries information.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is usually the inexperienced player who offers an astonishing amount
of gratuitous and un-sought-for advice.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is often difficult to refrain from showing pleasure at the
accomplishment of a desired purpose, but consider that undue<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a> elation is
most aggravating to the adversaries.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Post-mortems have their interest and, as a rule, are unmistakably
convincing.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Do not venture upon a post-mortem unless you are certain of what the
scalpel is going to reveal.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Do not continue to talk of harassing details when another hand is
awaiting play.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>General rules are formulated as an assistance to intelligent play.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Many brilliant plays are made in contravention to rules.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Certain laws that govern the<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a> technicalities are absolute, but rules in
general are not the masters of Bridge.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Rules should be considered second to circumstances and to the fall of
the cards.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>There are hands in Bridge which may be said to play themselves.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>All Bridge penalties should be strictly enforced.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>You gather the cards when your partner takes the first trick.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Do not ask to have the cards placed unless it is solely for your own
information.<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a></p>

<p>A player has not the right to have the cards placed after they have been
touched for the purpose of gathering them.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is unfair to revoke purposely, or to make a second revoke in order to
conceal the first.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The revoking side cannot win the game on that hand, nor score more than
28 points.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Clubs is a safer declaration, holding four with two honours, than
spades, when but one or two are held without an honour.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Luck is a false friend and only stays with you until you are in
trouble.<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a></p>

<p>A poor player is most a poor player when he knows not that he is a poor
player.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Lost tricks yield a crop of experience attained at the expense of
rubbers.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Inattention is a companion that will never travel alone.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>People who find it easy to decide for friends find it hard to decide for
themselves.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>People who have lots of advice to give dislike to take any.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The man who plays Bridge when he is angry is sure to make a mistake.<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a></p>

<p>There is some hope for the player who discovers he can be mistaken.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Improvement comes from avoiding other people's mistakes.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>He who plays the best talks the least of what he is doing.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Don't spend time grieving over a lost rubber that should be used in
playing the next.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Sometimes one hasty play will overthrow the results of a carefully
planned game.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Discouragement should make the player more resolute.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Preserve us from the bore who<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a> insists on turning conversation into
argument.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is the critical who are most sensitive to criticism.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The best way to deal with bad luck is to bear it gracefully.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The best players are always patient with the novice.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>There are those who teach one Bridge because they play so badly.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Many people are so busy playing that they don't pause to think how they
are playing.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Many call "bad luck" that which is only neglect to improve opportunity.<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a></p>

<p>He who is too busy to consider his faults will never take time to mend
them.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Those who think the least have the most time to criticise.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The expertness of the player who is at the pains to announce it may be
doubted.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Some people ask for criticism but grow angry if it is adverse.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is not so much your Bridge knowledge, but the use you make of it,
that counts.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The novice plays before he thinks, the expert thinks before he plays.<a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a></p>

<p>The silent player, like the dog that bites without growling, gets the
best hold on the game.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>There are people so absorbed in their own Bridge perfection that it is
impossible for them to see merit in anyone else.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>A good way to succeed in Bridge is to observe what is most successful
with others.</p>

<p class="titl">THE RUBBER</p>

<p>The partners first winning two games win the rubber. If the first two
games be won by the same partners, the third game is not played.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p class="titl">SCORING</p>

<p>A game consists of thirty points obtained by tricks alone, exclusive of
any points counted for honours, Chicane, or Slam.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Every hand is played out, and any points in excess of thirty<a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a> points
necessary for the game are counted.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Each trick above six counts two points when spades are trumps, four
points when clubs are trumps, six points when diamonds are trumps, eight
points when hearts are trumps, and twelve points when there are no
trumps.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Honours are ace, king, queen, knave, and ten of the trump suit; or the
aces when no-trump is declared.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Honours are credited to the original holders and are valued as follows:<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a></p>

<p>If a player and his partner make thirteen tricks, independently of any
tricks gained by the revoke penalty, they score Grand Slam and add forty
points to their honour count.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Little Slam is twelve tricks similarly scored, and adds twenty points to
the honour count.<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a></p>

<p>Chicane (one hand void of trumps) is equal in value to three honours,
<i>i.e.</i>, if partner of player having Chicane scores honours he adds the
value of three honours to his honour score, while, if the adversaries
score honours, it deducts an equal value from their honour score. Double
Chicane (a player and his partner both void of trumps) is equal in value
to four honours, and the value thereof may be deducted from the total
honour score of the adversaries.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The value of honours, Slam, Little Slam, or Chicane, is in no wise
affected by doubling or re-doubling.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>At the conclusion of a rubber<a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a> the scores for tricks, honours, Chicane,
and Slam, obtained by each side, are added, and one hundred points are
added to the score of the winners of the rubber. The difference between
the completed scores is the number of points won or lost by the winners
of the rubber.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If an erroneous score affecting tricks be proven, such mistake must be
corrected prior to the conclusion of the game in which it has occurred,
and such game shall not be considered as concluded until the following
deal has been completed and the trump declared, unless it be that the
game is the last one of the rubber,&mdash;then the score is subject to
inquiry<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a> until an agreement between the sides (as to the value of the
rubber) shall have been reached.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If an erroneous score affecting honours, Chicane, or Slam be proven,
such mistake may be corrected at any time before the score of the rubber
has been made up and agreed upon.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p class="titl">CUTTING</p>

<p>In cutting, the ace is the lowest card and, as between cards of
otherwise equal value, the lowest is the heart, next the diamond, next
the club, and highest the spade.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>In all cases every player must cut from the same pack.<a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a></p>

<p>Should a player expose more than one card, he must cut again.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p class="titl">FORMING TABLES</p>

<p>The prior right of playing is with those first in the room. If there are
more than four candidates for seats at a table, the privilege of playing
is decided by cutting. The four who cut the lowest cards play first.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>After the table is formed, the players cut to decide on partners; the
two lowest play against the two highest. The lowest is the dealer, who
has choice of cards and seats, and who, having once made his selection,
must abide by it.<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a></p>

<p>Six players constitute a full table, and no player shall have a right to
cut into a game which is complete.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>When there are more than six candidates, the right to succeed any player
who may retire is acquired by announcing the desire to do so, and such
announcement shall constitute a prior right to the first vacancy.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p class="titl">CUTTING OUT</p>

<p>At the end of a rubber, should admission be claimed by one or two
candidates, the player or players having played a greater number of
consecutive rubbers shall withdraw; but when all have played the same
number, they must cut<a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a> to decide upon the outgoers; the highest are out.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p class="titl">RIGHTS OF ENTRY</p>

<p>A candidate desiring to enter a table must declare such wish before any
player at the table cuts a card, either for the purpose of beginning a
new rubber or of cutting out.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>In the formation of new tables, those candidates who have neither
belonged to nor played at any other table have the prior right of entry.
Those who have already played decide their right of admission by
cutting.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>A player who cuts into one table while belonging to another shall<a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a>
forfeit his prior right of re-entry into the latter, unless by doing so
he enables three candidates to form a fresh table. In this event he may
signify his intention of returning to his original table, and his place
at the new one can be filled.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Should any player quit the table during the progress of a rubber, he
may, with the consent of the other three players, appoint a substitute
during his absence; but such appointment shall become void with the
conclusion of the rubber, and shall not in any way affect the
substitute's rights.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If anyone break up a table, the remaining players have a prior right to
play at other tables.<a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a></p>

<p class="titl">SHUFFLING</p>

<p>The pack must neither be shuffled below the table nor so the face of any

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>After the trump declaration has been made by the dealer or his partner,
their adversaries have the right to double. The eldest hand has the

I lead?" His partner shall answer, "Yes," or "I double."</p>

<p>If either of their adversaries elect to double, the dealer and his<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a>

"Satisfied." Should he say the latter, his partner may re-double.</p>

right to continue the re-doubling on behalf of a partnership belongs to

satisfied, the right to continue the re-doubling passes to his partner.
Should any player re-double out of turn, the adversary who last doubled
shall decide whether or not such double shall stand. If it is decided
that the re-double shall stand, the process of re-doubling may continue<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a>
as described in this and foregoing laws. If any double or re-double out
of turn be not accepted, there shall be no further doubling in that

portion of its face.</p></div>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If two or more cards be played at once, by either of the dealer's

face upward on the table and may be called at any time.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If, without waiting for his partner<a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a> to play, either of the dealer's
adversaries should play on the table the best card, or lead one which is
a winning card, as against the dealer and dummy, or should continue
(without waiting for his partner to play) to lead several such cards,
the dealer may demand that the partner of the player in fault win, if he
can, the first, or any other of these tricks, and the other cards thus
improperly played are exposed cards.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If either or both of the dealer's adversaries throw his or their cards

called; but if either adversary retain his hand he cannot be forced to
abandon it. If, however, the<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a> dealer should say, "I have the rest," or
any other words indicating that the remaining tricks are his, the

<p class="titl">CARDS PLAYED IN ERROR</p>

<p>Should the third hand not have played and the fourth play before his

the trick.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If anyone, not being dummy, omit playing to a former trick and such
error be not corrected until he has played to the next, the adversaries
may claim a new deal; should they decide that the deal stands good, the
surplus card at the end of the hand is considered to have been played to
the imperfect trick, but does not constitute a revoke therein.<a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a></p>

<p>If anyone (except dummy) play two cards to the same trick, or mix a card
with a trick to which it does not belong, and the mistake be not
discovered until the hand is played out, he is answerable for any
consequent revokes he may have made. If during the play of the hand the
error be detected, the tricks may be counted face downward, in order to
ascertain whether there be among them a card too many; should this be
the case, the trick which contains a surplus card may be examined and
the card restored to its original holder, who (not being dummy) shall be
liable for any revoke he may meanwhile have made.<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a></p>

<p class="titl">THE REVOKE</p>

<p>A revoke occurs when a player (other than dummy), holding one or more
cards of the suit led, plays a card of a different suit. The penalty for
a revoke takes precedence of all other counts.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>A revoke is established if the trick in which it occurs be turned and
quitted, <i>i.e.</i>, the hand removed from the trick after it has been
gathered and placed face downward on the table; or if either the
revoking player or his partner, whether in his right turn or otherwise,
have led or played to the following trick.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The penalty for a revoke is three tricks taken from the revoking<a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a> player
and added to those of the adversaries.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The penalty is applicable only to the score of the game in which it
occurs.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Under no circumstances can the revoking side score game, in that hand.
Whatever their previous score may have been, the side revoking cannot
attain a higher score toward game than twenty-eight.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>A player may ask his partner whether he has not a card of the suit which
he has renounced; should the question be asked before the trick is
turned and quitted, subsequent turning and quitting<a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a> does not establish
a revoke, and the error may be corrected unless the question be answered
in the negative or unless the revoking player or his partner has led or
played to the following trick.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If a player correct his mistake in time to save a revoke, any player or
players who have followed him may withdraw their cards and substitute
others, and the cards so withdrawn are not exposed cards. If the player
in fault be one of the dealer's adversaries, the card played in error is
an exposed card, and the dealer can call it whenever he pleases; or he
may require the offender to play his highest or lowest card of the suit
to the trick in which he has renounced.<a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a></p>

<p>If the player in fault be the dealer, the eldest hand may require him to
play the highest or lowest card of the suit in which he has renounced,
provided both adversaries of the dealer have played to the current
trick; but this penalty cannot be exacted against the dealer when he is
fourth in hand, nor can it be enforced at all from dummy.</p>

<p>At the end of a hand the claimants of a revoke may search all the
tricks. If the cards have been mixed the claim may be urged and proved
if possible; but no proof is necessary, and the revoke is established
if, after it has been claimed, the accused player or his partner mix the
cards before they<a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a> have been sufficiently examined by the adversaries.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>A revoke must be claimed before the cards have been cut for the
following deal.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Should the players on both sides subject themselves to the revoke
penalty neither can win the game by that hand.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The revoke penalty may be claimed for as many revokes as occur during a
hand; but the accumulated penalty shall in no event exceed thirteen
tricks.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p class="titl">GENERAL RULES</p>

<p>There should not be any consultation between partners as to<a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a> the
enforcement of penalties. If they do so consult, the penalty is paid.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Once a trick is complete, turned, and quitted, it must not be looked at
until the end of the hand.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Any player during the play of a trick, or after the four cards are
played and before they are touched for the purpose of gathering them
together, may demand that the cards be placed before their respective
players.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>If either of the dealer's adversaries, prior to his partner's playing,
should call attention to the trick, either by saying it is his, or,<a name="page_070" id="page_070"></a>
without being requested so to do, by naming his card or drawing it
toward him, the dealer may require that opponent's partner to play his
highest or lowest card of the suit led, or to win or lose the trick.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Either of the dealer's adversaries may call his partner's attention to
the fact that he is about to lead out of turn, but if he make any
unauthorised reference to any incident of the play the dealer may call a
suit from the adversary whose turn it is next to lead.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>In all cases where a penalty has been incurred, the offender is bound to
give reasonable time for the decision of his adversaries; but<a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a> if a
wrong penalty be demanded none can be enforced.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The partner of the eldest hand may inform him that their adversaries
have incurred a penalty, but may not give any further information.
Should he suggest the penalty, or demand the enforcement of it, such
action shall be deemed a consultation, and no penalty can be enforced.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p class="titl">NEW CARDS</p>

<p>Unless a pack be imperfect, no player shall have the right to call for
one new pack. If fresh cards are demanded, two packs must be furnished
and paid for by the player who has demanded them. If they are furnished
during a<a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a> rubber, the adversaries shall have their choice of new cards.
If it is the beginning of a new rubber, the dealer, whether he or one of
his adversaries be the party calling for the new cards, shall have the
choice. New cards must be called for before the pack is cut for a new
deal.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>A card or cards torn or marked must be replaced by agreement or new
cards furnished.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p class="titl">BYSTANDERS</p>

<p>While a bystander, by agreement among the players, may decide any
question, yet he must on no account say anything unless appealed to; and
if he make any remark which calls attention to an oversight<a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a> affecting
the score, or to the exaction of a penalty, he is liable to be called on
by the players to pay the stakes on that rubber.<a name="page_074" id="page_074"></a></p>

<p class="c">SPADE CONVENTION</p>

<p>I.&mdash;Where players agree "not to play spades" the rule is, that if the
spade make is not doubled, the hand shall be played where either side is
20 or over.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;If the third hand player ask, "Shall I play?" or should he lead out
of turn, or should the eldest hand lead without asking permission to
play, the spade maker may take two on the score or may call a lead and
require the hand to be played out.</p>

<p>III.&mdash;Should the third hand player double before his partner asks
permission to play, the spade maker may decide whether the double shall
stand or not; but the hand must be played out.<a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a></p>

<p class="c">ETIQUETTE</p>

<p>It has been truthfully said that there is no game in which slight
intimations can convey so much information as that of Bridge. In justice
to those who, by their manner, give information, it may be stated that
most of the apparent unfairness at the Bridge table is unintentional.
Hesitation and mannerisms, however, cannot be too carefully avoided;
such a breach of etiquette is an offence for which the adversaries have
no redress except perhaps a refusal to continue the play.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is obviously a greater fault to take advantage of information thus<a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a>
given. A play in your judgment may be perfectly sound, but you leave
yourself open to criticism if it is in any way contingent on information
obtained from your partner's manner.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Cultivate uniformity in your style of play; let there be no remarkable
haste or hesitation in making or passing; try always to use the same
formula of words, and do not call attention to the score after the cards
have been dealt.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Remember that any undue hesitancy in regard to doubling will deprive a
fair-minded partner of the privilege of so doing. Such delays are too
frequent at spade declarations.<a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a></p>

<p>Emphasise no play of your own and show no pleasure or displeasure at any
other play.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Do not ask to have the cards placed unless it is solely for your own
information.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is an offence either to revoke purposely or to make a second revoke
in order to conceal the first.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The dealer's partner should not call attention to the score nor to any
card or cards that he or the other players hold, and neither should he
leave his seat for the purpose of watching his partner's play.<a name="page_078" id="page_078"></a></p>

THE CHANGE THE SUIT<br />
CALL</p>

<p>"What is new in the game of Bridge?" is a reiterated question of the
day, and the invariable answer is "Nothing, nor does the lack of
innovation tend to simplify the play."</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>All Bridge players have experienced the agony of being forced to discard
a great suit, thoroughly established, on the dealer's lead, owing to the
fact that the partner has made two efforts to establish the suit he
originally opened.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>Many times this continuation is sound: the leader holds a re-entry<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a>
card, and he has secured no information as to his partner's strength
from the early development of the game.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>It is essential to good play that the dealer's adversaries should each
gain definite knowledge of the others' holding. Any information that a
play can convey is of inestimable help to them and of little or no
benefit to the dealer, who is the master of his own two hands.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>We all sympathise with that constantly uttered regret, "Oh, partner, if
I had only known that you had that suit," and Bridge players the world
over have felt the need of some conventional play that<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a> would indicate
to the original leader an adequate reason for a change of suit.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The Change the Suit Call is a new convention designed to overcome this
difficulty, one that will save countless tricks and rubbers, and one
that will tend to minimise the dealer's acknowledged advantage in
playing the two hands.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The convention is as follows: <i>When the original leader's partner has a
great suit, one that is established or one that may be established by a
single lead through the dummy hand, an echo should be made in the suit
led by the dealer.</i> In other words, an echo in the adversary's suit is a
command to the<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a> original leader to abandon his own unestablished suit
and to switch to his partner's declared strength.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The idea is of course based on the call for trumps in Whist, in which
game an echo in any plain suit is a command to the partner to lead
trumps. In Bridge it is used principally at no-trump and its application
is limited to an echo on the <i>dealer's</i> lead.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>The reader will naturally ask, "How, when but two suits have been led,
can I determine which of the two remaining to choose?" The cards in the
leader's hand combined with those in the dummy will usually simplify the
selection. Should the leader hold a re-entry<a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a> in one of the remaining
suits it is obvious that he has been asked to lead the other. When it
happens that both the leader and the dummy are weak in both suits, the
preference should usually be given to the one in which the combined
hands contain the fewer number of cards.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>This convention may, moreover, be used to great advantage by the
original leader. How frequently he finds his suit hopelessly against
him. Perhaps he holds no re-entry and the dealer in winning the first
trick false cards. It is then that the original leader can use this echo
to effect, to suggest that his suit should not be returned.<a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a></p>

<p>"The Change the Suit Call" may also be employed to some advantage on the
dealer's trump or plain suit lead, to show great strength in one of the
remaining suits, or by the original leader to indicate that the suit
first led is not to be returned; but its main importance is in the
no-trump application.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/ill_break.png" width="55" height="19" alt="thought break" /></p>

<p>"The Change the Suit Call" is an absolutely sound trick-gaining
proposition, and the successful results obtained from its use must
rapidly establish it as a recognised convention of the game.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
